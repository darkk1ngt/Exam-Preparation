# REMEMBER THE DISTINCTION FORMULA

```
D = J + D + U + I + L

J = JUSTIFY everything
D = DETAIL (third party could replicate)
U = USER-focused (not just requirements)
I = ITERATIVE (test → fix → retest)
L = LEGAL awareness applied
```

---

# RED FLAGS (things that lose marks)

❌ Describing WHAT instead of explaining WHY
❌ Defining terms instead of applying them
❌ Generic requirements not linked to scenario
❌ Designs without specifications
❌ Code without comments
❌ Only testing with normal data
❌ Test plans without strategy first
❌ Relying only on IDE for testing
❌ Evaluating requirements but not USER experience
❌ Ignoring legal/ethical considerations

---

# GOLDEN RULES

1. **Every decision needs a justification**
2. **Always link back to the scenario**
3. **User needs > Technical requirements**
4. **Show your working (iterations)**
5. **Apply legislation, don't define it**
6. **Test with normal, erroneous, AND extreme data**
7. **Comments in code are essential**
8. **Be honest about limitations**
